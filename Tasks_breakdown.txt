Breakdown of tasks:


TASK 1: Data Retrieving 

1. Select dataset:  Occupancy dataset (backup) .   <- DONE
2. Select goal of project.


TASK 2: Data Exploration

1. Explore columns (univariate exploration)

date time year-month-day hour:minute:second SD/MG
Temperature, in Celsius MG
Relative Humidity, % MG
Light, in Lux SD
CO2, in ppm SD
Humidity Ratio, Derived quantity from temperature and relative humidity, in kgwater-vapor/kg-air  MG


2. Explore relationships between pairs of columns (bivariate exploration)
  - Graph
  SD: light vs co2
      light vs temp
      co2 vs humidity
      
  MG: temp vs humidity
      humidity vs humidity ratio
      time vs light
      
  - Hypothesis
  


TASK 3: Data Modellling

1. Select model: Classification . <- DONE
2. Split into training & test set.
3. Train the model
4. Test accura
TASK 4: Report

- Cover page, table of contents, abstract, reference
- Intro: SD
Introduction:
- Why is this topic important - Energy consumption reduction potential from having sensors that don't require human control
- Look at individual variables and why this could be a good indicator of human presence in an office (eg. humidity, CO2 - respiration etc., Light . )
- Past literature in the topic: Candanedo lists a few past projects that have done similar things with sensors
        What were the reported accuracies/ precision from the models that have been used before?
        What features did they use? (CO2, light, temperature, DateTime(nobody), humidity ??)
        What models they used? (benefits and drawbacks) 
- Hypothesis: 
        Both classification models, Knearest neighbours and Decision Trees, will be able to accurately predict occupancy of an office room.
